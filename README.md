# 🪪 Pinq Protocol

**The Walletless Identity Layer for Web3.**

Pinq Protocol is reimagining identity for the decentralized world — human-first, secure, and wallet-optional. We’re building the infrastructure that lets users verify, link, and own their identity in Web3 with simplicity and style.

## 🔍 What is Pinq Protocol?

Pinq Protocol is a modular, walletless identity layer for Web3 that allows users to:

- Verify identity using modern sign-in flows (no wallets required)
- Link on-chain and off-chain identifiers
- Enable frictionless onboarding and UX for dApps
- Create "meta accounts" powered by smart contract wallets (ERC-4337)

---

## 🚀 Why Pinq?

- **Human-first** — We believe Web3 should work like the internet does today. Easy, familiar, and fast.
- **Wallet-optional** — Users can connect or ditch wallets entirely and still have full identity control.
- **Modular & Open** — Developers can plug in and build any identity experience using our SDKs and smart contracts.
- **Future-ready** — Built on Account Abstraction (ERC-4337), optimized for both EVM chains and beyond.
